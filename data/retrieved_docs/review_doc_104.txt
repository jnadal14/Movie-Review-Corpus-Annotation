One man\u2019s implosion (fission) catalyzes another\u2019s explosion (fusion), Los Alamos is ground zero. The final hour is the consequences, the chain reaction, the near-zero that is not zero. It\u2019s the perfect film for Nolan to fully meld theory (read: screenwriting) with mathematics (read: filmmaking)."}
