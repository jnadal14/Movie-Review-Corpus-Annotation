    "Review": "A ridiculous achievement in filmmaking. An absurdly immersive and heart-pounding experience. Cillian Murphy is a fucking stud and RDJ will be a front-runner for Best Supporting Actor. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson put his entire nutsack into that score, coupled with a sound design that made me feel like I took a bomb to the chest."
