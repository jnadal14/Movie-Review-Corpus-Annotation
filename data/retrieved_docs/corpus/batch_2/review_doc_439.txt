{"Reviewer": "HAL", "Profile_URL": "https://letterboxd.com/citizenhal/", "Review": "Now I am become HAL, watcher of Oppenheimer.Anyway, lots to appreciate, the kind of Nolan film that you want to experience again and again to truly learn everything it does. For now, recognizing Jack Quaid and having the Best of the Worst episode with Stone Cold coming full circle is satisfying enough."}
