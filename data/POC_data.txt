A ridiculous achievement in filmmaking. An absurdly immersive and heart-pounding experience. Cillian Murphy is a fucking stud and RDJ will be a front-runner for Best Supporting Actor. Ludwig G√∂ransson put his entire nutsack into that score, coupled with a sound design that made me feel like I took a bomb to the chest.

While this movie feels a bit tedious to watch at times, the payoffs make it absolutely worth it. The way Nolan conveys anxiety and dread is masterfully done. RDJ was great and Cillian Murphy was incredible. I'd also like to add that this is one of those movies that would benefit a shit-ton from subtitles (due to Nolan's obsession with loud noises and intense background music). There's one love-making scene that I thought was pretty silly, other than that this is a master class in filmmaking.Ending the movie with Oppenheimer saying "boom bitch" directly to the camera was a strange decision, but I respect it.

A technical marvel, a historical terror, and a display of some of the finest acting of this generation. Oppenheimer is the best movie of 2023.I am so, so sad. Sad at the fact that Cillian Murphy is just now finally getting his flowers as a leading man in Hollywood. Murphy delivers truly one of the best lead acting performances I have seen in years, but Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt are every bit his equal and all 3‚Ä¶

Never seen a biopic with such graceful, grand, sweeping presentation like this. The film's constructed to give that feeling of being on the precipice of something equally awe-inspiring, and terrifying.The last hour lost momentum for me but this was probably Nolan's most successful film on an emotional level.Full Review

A chaotic, behemoth bore. In its most compelling moments, it captures in sound and image the cosmological sin of harnessing nature for slaughter, but the rest is plodding, dry, sub-Sorkin morality politics without enough insight or complexity to avoid hagiography.Full review here.

This is an epic film of unbelievable magnitude. Unquestionably a technical masterpiece that never stops stunning with its jaw-dropping visuals and awe-inspiring musical score and sound design, Similar to this, its challenging, compelling narrative offers much to consider from both a moral and a bureaucratic perspective. resulting in a visceral, dramatic, and exciting film that proves Christopher Nolan's talent for creating a visual spectacle. The third act, in my opinion, lost a lot of its concentration and just flowed illogically‚Ä¶

What does a Christopher Nolan do when he tackles a genre - the biopic - that is per definition hard to dissect into narrative trickery and tough to dance with in experimental technomaniacism?Oppenheimeris still a very palpable nolanesque film: it's dynamic, jumpy, galvanic, disjointed. Hoyte van Hoytema can at least get a little playful here and there with some fizzy-whizzing abstractions of nuclear reactions and floating star sightings.

5th viewing of this now, and I can't say enough about how much I think it outperforms anything else Nolan has accomplished in his career so far. A magnificent epic of unimaginable proportions, as Nolan is used to. However, this one is both morally rigorous and powerful. Clearly at the pinnacle of his artistic powers. Its visceral impact is long-lasting; as many have noted, the post-bombing speech and the trinity test sequence are both jaw-dropping, hyper-focused on absorbing and tearing‚Ä¶
